# Propose Net-New Code Rule

Rule to prevent the agent from creating unrequested example code without confirmation.

<rule>
name: propose_net_new_code
description: Requires the agent to propose the creation of new, non-trivial example code before writing it.
filters:
  # Match during planning or demonstration phases
  - type: content
    pattern: "(?i)(to demonstrate|for example|as a sample|create a sample)"

actions:
  - type: suggest
    message: |
      **When demonstrating a new pattern or category, propose the creation of example code before implementing it.**

      Instead of building a full component that might not be needed, ask the user for confirmation first. This avoids wasted effort and ensures the example is relevant to the user's goals.

      ### ✅ Good Interaction Flow
      1.  **Agent**: "I've created the `compounds` category. To demonstrate how it works, I propose creating a sample `TransferForm` component that groups together several transfer-related elements. Would you like me to proceed with creating this example?"
      2.  **User**: "No, that's not necessary. I understand the concept."
      3.  **Agent**: "Understood. I will skip creating the example and move on to the next step."

      ### ❌ Bad Interaction Flow
      1.  **Agent**: "I've created the `compounds` category and built a `TransferForm` component as an example." (Builds the component files).
      2.  **User**: "That wasn't necessary, please remove it."
      3.  **Agent**: (Deletes the files it just created).

      ### When to Propose
      - Before creating a new file that is purely for demonstration.
      - When adding a significant amount of code that wasn't part of the explicit request.
      - When the value of an example is uncertain.

examples:
  - input: |
      Agent plans to create a new category and then build a sample component inside it.
    output: |
      First, create the category structure. Then, before building the sample component, ask the user: "To demonstrate this, I can create a sample `[ComponentName]`. Shall I proceed?"
