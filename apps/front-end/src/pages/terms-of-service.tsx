            <p>
              Stableit is a cross-blockchain application for the management of
              digital assets that was implemented, deployed and operated by
              Stableit and an open-source software development kit (“SDK”) that
              overlays CCTP and other proprietary software.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stableit Bridge is designed for users seeking a streamlined
              bridging and swapping experience where they can manage their
              blockchain assets in one place. It combines a traditional Web2
              front-end and back-end. Some features below:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Simplified Bridging: Showcases the power of the SDK and how it
                  can power simplified user experiences, giving users access to
                  universal gas drop-off, gasless payments, and automatic
                  relaying.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Portfolio: Provide enriched experience for the user to see
                  assets across their associated wallets in one place.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Stableit SDK (the “SDK”) is a new software development kit that
              the Stableit Bridge is built on top of. The Stableit SDK makes
              transferring USDC and potentially other stablecoins easy to use.
              The key features of the SDK include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Feature Consistency</p>
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Relay-Priority: Automatic delivery: Automatic delivery of
                    assets will always be preferred over manual options.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Universal Gas Dropoff: Always request gas on any route.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Gasless Payments: Users can pay gas in any currency,
                    avoiding the need for users to hold specific assets for gas.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In sum, Stableit aims to elevate the bridging experience, offering
              greater clarity, improved performance, and a seamless integration
              path for users and integrators alike.

                  Our Services are evolving over time, and we may change or
                  discontinue all or any part of the Services at any time for
                  any person without notice at our sole discretion.

                  We reserve the right to withdraw or amend this App or SDK and
                  any service or material we provide on the App and SDK at our
                  sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if, for
                  any reason, all or any part of the App and SDK is unavailable
                  at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may
                  restrict users&apos; access to some parts of the App/SDK or
                  the entire App/SDK.

                  We may modify the Terms at any time at our sole discretion. If
                  we do so, we will let you know either by posting the modified
                  Terms on the Site, by providing you a notice through the
                  Service, or through other methods of communication that we
                  deem reasonable. The modified Terms will be effective at the
                  time they are posted on the Site. It’s important that you
                  review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you
                  continue to use the Services after we have modified the Terms,
                  you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you do not
                  agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use
                  the Services.

                <p>
                  In order to access certain features and services provided on
                  the App, you need to connect a supported source wallet (a
                  “Wallet”), which will facilitate transactions or verify your
                  ownership of certain digital assets. By connecting your Wallet
                  with the App, you authorize us to access your Wallet for the
                  purpose of permitting you to view or convert digital assets or
                  engage in other transactions or actions. We do not assume any
                  liability with respect to any Wallet. You must familiarize
                  yourself with the terms of service, technology, and security
                  protocols of any Wallet (e.g., saving your backup phrase in a
                  safe place). It’s important to keep in mind that when you use
                  your Wallet on the App, you represent to us that your account
                  on any Wallet used by you in connection with the App is owned
                  or controlled exclusively and directly by you and no other
                  person. We reserve the right, at any time, in our sole
                  discretion, to block access to the App from certain IP
                  addresses and unique device identifiers.

                  <b>Transaction Delays</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Due to factors beyond our control, such as blockchain
                  congestion, gas hikes, and other third-party software issues,
                  the App does not provide a guaranteed timeline for when the
                  transactions will be completed and the digital assets will be
                  bridged between blockchains and reach your designated wallet.
                  If you experience any abnormal bridging time delays, please
                  reach out to us and we will assist you in debugging and
                  processing the delayed transaction.

            </p>
            <p>
              By using the Services, you represent that you have sufficient
              knowledge and experience in business and financial matters,
              including a sufficient understanding of blockchain technologies,
              cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, storage mechanisms, and
              blockchain-based software systems to be able to assess and
              evaluate the risks and benefits of the Services contemplated
              hereunder, and will bear the risks thereof, including loss of all
              amounts paid and all digital assets transferred, and the risk that
              the cryptocurrencies and other digital assets may have little or
              no value. You acknowledge and agree that there are risks
              associated with purchasing and holding cryptocurrency and using
              blockchain technology. These include, but are not limited to, risk
              of losing access to cryptocurrency due to slashing, loss of
              private key(s), custodial error or purchaser error, risk of mining
              or blockchain attacks, risk of hacking and security weaknesses,
              risk of unfavorable regulatory intervention in one or more
              jurisdictions, risk related to token taxation, risk of personal
              information disclosure, risk of uninsured losses, volatility
              risks, and unanticipated risks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Smart contracts execute automatically when certain conditions are
              met. We do not have the ability to reverse a transaction that is
              recorded on a public blockchain. You are responsible for ensuring
              that any details entered you enter in connection with a
              transaction using any smart contracts are accurate and complete.
              Further, since smart contracts typically cannot be stopped or
              reversed, vulnerabilities in their programming and design or other
              vulnerabilities that may arise due to hacking or other security
              incidents can have adverse effects to digital assets, including
              but not limited to significant volatility and risk of loss.
            </p>
            <p>
              You acknowledge that there are inherent risks associated with
              using or interacting with public blockchains and blockchain
              technology. There is no guarantee that such technology will be
              unavailable or subject to errors, hacking or other security risks.
              Underlying blockchain protocols may also be subject to sudden
              changes in operating rules, including forks, and it is your
              responsibility to make yourself aware of upcoming operating
              changes.

              You further understand that Stableit is not a financial or
              investment advisor and that the Services entail a risk of loss of
              your digital assets. All transactions submitted by you using our
              Services are unsolicited, which means they are solely initiated by
              you.
